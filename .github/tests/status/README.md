# Status

All tests run in the `workflows/status.yml` workflow use the Blackfire Player to run through various scenarios, relating to demo variations. 
Scenario files (`.github/tests/status/scenarios/*.bkf`) include _groups_ (`.github/tests/status/groups/*.bkf`) that ensure known endpoints have the correct statuses.
